Methodically created models based on various variable selection techniques then analyzed said models in terms of accuracy. I also learned to detect various issues within the models such as over-fitting and multicollinearity by the use of graphs and intuition. The basic concepts of logistic regression were also taught. Both SAS and R were used to create and analyze these models.">Linear Regression</button></li>

The various technical actuarial terms were taught along with the specific formulas and notations. The different types of life insurance policies were presented as well as how to calculate the assumed profit from each. Life contingency tables were used to aid these calculations. While this class didn't teach the first actuarial exam in full, the professor gave advice on how to proceed with studying and taking it.">Actuarial Models</button></li>

Along with that, we learned about different types of sampling techniques as well as how to use them to conduct a proper survey. How to analyze surveys using introductory statistical methods such as hypothesis testing and graph evaluation were also taught. The end of semester project had the class work in groups to design a proper survey with a university-life focus. Statistical analysis for the class was done with both R and SAS.">Survey and Sampling</button></li>

We were taught about many probability distrubutions; their properties and when to use them. The theory and practical uses behind random variables and other basic statistical properties. At the end of the second course, a group project was given that had the class try and modify a probability distribution to fit a set of data given. R was used in the course.">Mathmatical Statistics</button></li>

This included lessons on how to split treatments up randomly and fairly and how many replications are needed to get a meaningful result. We were taught how to analyze these results and how to draw reasonable conclusions based on the data. The end of semester project included an analysis and critique of an experiment used in a scientific research paper.

Many classification and prediction methods were taught along with the properties behind them and which circumstance is best for each method. There was a large focus on classification such as logistic regression, Knn and SVM. Clustering and neural networks were touched on a bit towards the end of the course. The end of semester project was a solo project that required us to choose a dataset and a specific question we had to answer using many of the techniques learned. A lengthy report was required to communicate the results. This course used R for all data cleaning and machine learning.">Data Science</button></li>

The structures covered includes lists, maps, trees and graphs while the algorithms were mostly sorting algorithms. Written and coding labs were done individually to test the knowledge of how the structures worked and then implemented them in Eclipse. The structures covered includes lists, maps, trees and graphs while the algorithms were mostly sorting algorithms. Projects allowed for us to work in pairs to devise algorithms and basic program structure based on specifications given. The coding portion of the two projects were done individually based on a rough structure given.">Data Structures</button></li>

Most of the other classes showed us how to use these languages in the specific way for that topic. These were just meant to give us that Introduction. The SAS course was a little more in-depth than the R one. It taught almost everything for the base SAS certification. While taking the certification wasn't required, it was encouraged to sometime after the course.">Statistical Programming</button></li>

This Java class was the second of two mainline Java courses in the department. Advanced programming techniques and designs such as FSM, polymorphism and inheritance was taught in this course. Projects were done individually and required you to design a program using one or more of the design techniques from class based on specifications given. Group labs were completed every week with a guided programming structure. The C/C++ course mostly consisted of C. The course was taught as a comparison to what we learned in Java. There was quite a focus on memory and pointers since they are harder to implement in C. Debugging tools such as the GDB and Valgrind were stressed since it taught us to debug for ourselves rather than have a TA or professor do it. C++ was brought it a little at the end of the course. It was implied that we have the skills to figure the rest of it out for ourselves.">General Programming</button></li>

						<p class="margin-tb-30">This was a summer internship through my local government. I worked mainly solo inside the technology department, where previous datasets had been created over the years. Every few days I was tasked with something different. Everywhere from cleaning spreadsheets to making visualizations of data to convey certain information. This internship was not so much statistically advanced, but I was able to refine my data cleaning skills and lower level analysis, which is the foundation of everything analysts and data scientists do. Having a solid foundation is always helpful. Below is a brief list of the things I was tasked to do.</p>
						<ul class="list margin-b-30">
							<li>Managed various datasets including cleaning and updating data.</li>
							<li>Provided analysis to spot trends.</li>
							<li>Assisted other departments in creating infographics from various data.</li>

I've been a part of marching band throughout high school and college as well was many symphonic bands, pep bands and wind ensembles over the years.

It is a way for me to escape the stresses of everyday for a little while. I can honestly say that I probably wouldn't be where I am today without video games. Many years ago, video games sparked my interest in computers. Particularly, wanting to make a game for myself. While I haven't fully completed building a game yet, it got me into programming. Also, my first use of a spreadsheet can be credited to a video game long ago. I've used them to track my progress or come up with the best strategies using formulas and algorithms. Now with my current knowledge, I can model in game stock markets, figure the probabilities of certain item drops and even make some games "play" themselves using machine learning. Gaming has been a long time hobby of mine, but it was opened important doors in my life.</p>
